# 🎯 Exam Marks Predictor

A simple machine learning project that predicts a student's exam score based on the number of hours they study. Built using Python and scikit-learn, this project demonstrates a basic implementation of **linear regression**.

---

## 📊 Project Description

This project takes historical data of students' study hours and their corresponding exam scores to train a model. Given new input (hours of study), it predicts the expected marks.

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (optional for plotting)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mr-inception/Exam_Marks_Pridictor.git
cd Exam_Marks_Pridictor
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python installed. Then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Or manually install:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

### 3. Run the Project

```bash
python predictor.py
```

You'll be prompted to enter the number of hours studied.

---

## 📁 Example Input

```
Enter the number of hours you want to study: 6
Predicted Score: 75.0
```

## 📈 Sample Data Used

| Hours Studied | Exam Score |
| ------------- | ---------- |
| 2             | 50         |
| 4             | 65         |
| 6             | 75         |
| 8             | 85         |
| 10            | 95         |
